# The next pizza night is:
**Friday, August, 29th, any time after 5 pm ET.**

I've got enough dough for six medium pizzas. Once I'm out - I'm out.

## Address?
Text me and I'll send it to you.

## Toppings?
If you have something special you want to do bring it or request it ahead of time. Otherwise I'll try to have a few beyond just cheese. 

## RSVP?
Up to you. Just don't surprise me at like 1 am unless you bring whiskey.

## Sides and drinks? 
Bring your own. I'm just making pizza's. There's a garden hose outside for water. I also have some liquor and beer/seltzers.

## Bringing Kids?
That's fine. Just let me know ahead of time if you don't mind in case we need to hide non-kid-friendly shit.
