# The next pizza night is:
**Friday, December 12th, any time after 6:00 pm ET.**

I've got enough dough for six medium pizzas. Partners/significant others welcome. Once I'm out - I'm out. Read the details below

## Address?
Text me and I'll send it to you.

## Sides and drinks? 
Bring your own. I'm just making pizza's. There's a garden hose outside for water. I also have some liquor and beer/seltzers.

## Bringing Kids?
I would advise against it since I'm baking most of the time and we can't keep eyes on people's kids. If it's like toddlers/babies or grown kids that's fine. 

## Toppings?
If you have something special you want to do bring it or request it ahead of time. Otherwise I'll try to have a few beyond just cheese. 

## RSVP?
Up to you. Just don't surprise me at 1 am unless you bring whiskey.
