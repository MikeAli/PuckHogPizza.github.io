# The next pizza night is:
**Friday, October, 24st, any time after 5:30 pm ET.**

I've got enough dough for six medium pizzas. Partners/significant others welcome. Once I'm out - I'm out. Read the details below

## Address?
Text me and I'll send it to you.

## Sides and drinks? 
Bring your own. I'm just making pizza's. There's a garden hose outside for water. I also have some liquor and beer/seltzers.

## Bringing Kids?
Let me know ahead of time in case we need to hide non-kid-friendly shit. Just remember that you are in charge of watching your kids - I'm gonna be busy doing pizza stuff.

## Toppings?
If you have something special you want to do bring it or request it ahead of time. Otherwise I'll try to have a few beyond just cheese. 

## RSVP?
Up to you. Just don't surprise me at 1 am unless you bring whiskey.
